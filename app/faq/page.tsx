          ques="Where is IIIT Dharwad located?"
          ans="The new campus of IIIT Dharwad is located in a 60-acre plot between the two cities of Hubballi and Dharwad. It is close to both cities and also the Hubballi Airport (UBX) yet away from all the traffic, noise and pollution. The location is indeed pristine, right where the hills start on the way to Western Ghats. It is also the catchment area of river Shalmala that flows down to join Arabian Sea near Karwar. Dharwad is a well-known center for higher learning including music and arts. Hubballi-Dharwad are having a significant concentration of Higher Educational institutions and universities of repute including Indian Institute of Technology-Dharwad (IIT Dharwad), Karnataka University Dharwad, University of Agricultural Sciences Dharwad, Karnataka State Law University, KLE Technological University, Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences and Hospital, SDM College of Medical Sciences and Hospital, SDM Dental Sciences and Hospital, and SDM College of Engineering and Technology.
Hubballi-Dharwad are twin cities, now being developed as smart cities in the state of Karnataka and together form the 2nd largest urban city next to Bangalore. The two cities are connected by a modern BRTS - Bus Rapid Transit System - that provides convenient access to our campus. The cities are located 410 kms from Bangalore city with excellent connectivity by air, rail and road to Bangalore, thereby enabling IIIT Dharwad to reap rich dividends from the strengths of Bangalore as the nationâ€™s IT hub."

              B.Tech curricula are designed in the Outcome Based Education
              framework with well-defined program objectives. Each B.Tech
              program has an ideal mix of foundational theory and core subjects
              (30%), Breadth in engineering, mathematics, and sciences (25%),
              soft skills and humanities (10%), contemporary elective subjects
              in applied areas (25%), and project-based learning through a
              series of mini and major projects (10%). Most elective subjects
              are kept open for any student in any program to take the
              specialized courses of their choice. The eighth semester has no
              coursework to enable students to carry out the major project and
              pursue a full-semester internship in the industry or other reputed
              institutes.
